Description: An R Markdown html document format that provides the ability to lazily
    load plot outputs as the user scrolls over them.  This is useful for large R
    Markdown documents with many plots, as it allows for a fast initial page load and
    defers loading of individual graphics to the time that the user navigates near them.
